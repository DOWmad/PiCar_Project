## PiCar Project

This is a model for a small raspberry pi autonmous car.
It recognises several traffic signs.

### Phase 1,2 and 3

The building of the car:

## Dataset

* Image sie: 28x28
* Number of Stop_Sign images:
* Number of RailRoad images:
* Number of Yield_Sign images: 
* Number of High_Speed images
* Number of Low_Speed images
* Number of Signal images: 

Setting up the OS and configuring it to be used.

## Phase 4

### CNN Architecture:

Creating the Neural Network model to recognise stop sign initially.

However, the model for this group recognises 6 signs.

1. Stop
2. Yield
3. Low speed
4. High speed
5. RailRoad
6. Signal (traffic light)
